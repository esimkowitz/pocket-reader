## TODO

1. [ ] Update `playNext` and `playPrevious` actions to play next/previous article, rather than next/previous audio asset.
1. [ ] Add blurb to beginning of each article to announce the title and author
1. [âœ”] Reduce the delay with loading new article segments (maybe cache them in the background?)
1. [ ] Figure out how long audio assets should be held onto before discarding
    - Should they be deleted immediately after use?
    - Should I try to incoorporate a smart caching scheme (probably not this one)?
1. [ ] Add ability to queue unspecified number of articles
    - i.e. play back all articles until told to stop
